Abductors,"""Spice up your day-to-day tasks as an exercise and see wonders. This exercise is definitely one of the spice elements done with an abductor machine that relieves knee discomfort while also improving core muscle activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
""""The hip abduction machine exercise is an exercise used to strengthen the abductors.

The abductors play a critical role in core stability and having strong abductors can result in better personal records on the squat and deadlift.

From an aesthetic perspective, performing hip abduction isolation exercises assists in the development of a full pair of glutes and hips.""""
